# AI-Powered-Classroom-Assistant
This project presents an AI-powered educational assistant built using the OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit and a Phi-2 language model quantized to INT4 precision. The model is fine-tuned for answering student-specific educational queries, offering fast and optimized performance on Intel hardware (CPU/Iris Xe GPU).



Features:
->Based on Phi-2 language model (by Microsoft).

->Optimized using INT4 quantization for fast inference.

->Fine-tuned with 30 educational prompts (JSON format).

->Deployable on Windows with CPU/GPU.

->Accepts text queries and generates accurate answers.

To implement the project,
Make sure to download python(3.10+ recommended).
